            <p>We kicked off our bride/groom eras this summer with bachelor/bachelorette parties.<br>
                Nicole's Bachelorette was a weekend of wine, crafts, and getting sunburnt on a beach. <br>
                Alec's Bachelor party...was exactly the type of mayhem and chaos you might expect from him. A 6 player magic game, Mistborn style dnd, board games and laser tag.</p>

            <img src="IMG_9176.jpg" alt="Honeymoon photo">
            <p>We honeymooned in Thailand! We visited 3 cities in 10 days - Bangkok, Chiang Mai, and Krabi. In Bangkok, we explored the city and Thai culture, visiting temples and eating as much food as we could (including crickets!). In Chiang Mai, we went on outdoor adventures in the mountains and participated in the traditions of two festivals - Loy Krathong and Yi Peng. In Krabi, we escaped the city and relaxed by the ocean for our final few days, before returning home. We even managed to squeeze in a super quick tour of Istanbul on the way home!</p>

        <h2>Travel & Adventures</h2>
        <div class="image-paragraph">
            <img src="nyc.jpg" alt="NYC photo">
            <p>As the weather started to warm up in April, we took a weekend trip to NYC to visit Andrew (Shedd) and his fiancé Emma! It was Alec's first time in the city and he got the full experience, including avoiding the crazy homeless people on the subway. They planned a great trip for us as we devoured the finest New York cuisine (without the lines). Alec was rather disappointed that he never saw Spiderman but we did see dinosaur bones in the Museum of Natural History which sated his nerd appetite (of course he had to provide commentary about the dinosaurs and tell Nicole about which ones are in a video game he used to play)</p>

            <p>We went leaf peeping the weekend after our wedding - camping on the Goldenberg's land in NH with friends. We hiked MT Cannon, our 2nd 4000 footer together.</p>

            <img src="swim.jpg" alt="Buzzards Bay race photo">
            <p>Nicole started getting back in the pool and training with the Worcester Area Master's team this year. She entered a race, swimming a mile across Buzzards Bay and raised money to support clean water in the Bay. She endured the cold water that Alec went in at Maritime. We even put a paddleboard on our wedding registry so Alec can keep up with her while she trains next year! S.o to seamus for buying it for us</p>

            <img src="spartan.jpg" alt="Killington photo">
            <p>With the fall came our Spartan Races. Nicole and Alec both completed trifectas (sprint 5k, super 10k, and beast 21k in a calendar year), Nicole for the first time! We completed the super and sprint on back to back days in Barre, MA in August. In September, we did Spartan's hardest beast - up Killington mountain in Vermont. Alec had an undefeated age group season and was top 10 overall in his three races this year. Nicole placed 3rd in age group at the beast. She got a well deserved cheeseburger after that one.</p>

            <p>We opened the year with our annual Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Day of service through our continued volunteering with the Travis Manion Foundation. For this year, we donated and rucked food for 4 miles to Veterans Inc in Worcester, a non profit that assists Veterans in the area in numerous ways including housing, jobs, and food.</p>

            <img src="https://via.placeholder.com/300x200" alt="Cleanup photo">
            <p>Admittedly, our winter months are less of an adventure type and our next notable excursion wasn't until our annual Earth Day Cleanup in April (also with the Travis Manion Foundation). We cleaned the Middle River by Holy Cross. To say it was appalling how many tires we pulled out on just a small stretch of the river is an understatement. This cleanup was in honor of Alec's late Great Uncle Peanut who passed earlier in the year.</p>

                Twix just turned 10 this year. We held a birthday party for her and the guest of honor hid the whole time. Perhaps she doesnt want to confront how old she is.<br>
                Charlie is still being her silly self and enjoys her nature channel on the TV as she sits directly infront of it (despite our scolding saying she's too close).</p>
